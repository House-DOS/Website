    <h1>House-DOS</h1>
    <i>A real-mode x86 Operating System Written Fully in X86 Assembler</i>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Welcome to the House-DOS Project!
      I created the House-DOS project in June of 2020, in the midst of the most boring summer break in modern history.
      I've been fascinated with low-level computing for years, and was interested in looking into operating-system design.
      So, naturally, I wanted to <i>make</i> one.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wasn't my first try at an operating system.
      I attempted to make an operating system the year before, also entirely in assembler.
      However, I was designing it around a graphical interface from the start.
      This led me to ignore the more important bits of any system, like programs, memory management, files, and general code cleanliness.
      Also, I wasn't nearly as experienced in assembler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having learned from my previous failure, I started by researching the FAT filesystem and taking a look at example code.
      I then wrote code to read files off of a FAT16 filesystem, using BIOS disk functions and lots of logic.
      I started creating an interface for programs to work with the kernel through system calls.
      I continued expanding the capabilities of the kernel and created a basic feature set of programs: a file writer, and a file viewer.
      And then I had my first full version, <code>v0.0.0</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I continued, I began thinking about a structural element I wanted to add.
      Something that would unify the system and provide a base for programs to work off of.
      That, of course, was what I called the I/O Buffer.
      Effectively, a place where programs would be given an input, and where programs would store their output to be given to the user.
      It would also double as the place where files were loaded into.
      This would open up many capabilities I always associated with UNIX systems, like output forwarding and pipelines, as well as device files.
      These things always seemed really cool, and I knew they would also be very useful features.
    </p>
    <p>
      I continued expanding the feature-set of the kernel and developed utility programs to harness those features, and eventually, I ended up with a <i>usable system.</i>
      Usable, in that it had all the basic file operations one could ask for, including a full-on text-editor.
      But seriously, it was usable, and that to me was simply amazing.
      I never would have thought that I could have developed an operating system that read and wrote files, renamed and deleted them, and had a calculator.
      And beyond that, it had a vast array of system calls, which opened up possibilities for innumerable other programs that I'm not creative enough to even comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I can't mention any of this without mentioning the people who helped me along the way.
      I'd like to thank Ben for all his work, including helping me a lot with debugging code and fixing logic, as well as creating the text editor.
      I'd also like to thank Jet for his interest in the project, and his work on a soon-to-be-released game (it's in the process of being optimized/cleaned).
      Finally, I'd also like to thank Derrick for his help in making some of the design choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last thing I'd like to talk about is one important thing I learned (and still am learning) the hard way:
      <b>DON'T MESS AROUND WITH SEGMENTATION TOO MUCH.</b>
      Seriously, keeping track of segment registers is too much work, and I didn't begin with a system in mind for making it easier.
      I can't tell you how many times something hasn't worked, the wrong number has been read, or something in general just goes wrong all because I forgot to re-set a segment register.
      So please, if you try something like this, come up with a system beforehand.
